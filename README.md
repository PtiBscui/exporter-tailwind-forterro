# Tailwind Exporter


This Tailwind exporter is an extension to the CSS exporter. It generates an additional file, `tailwind-variables.js` that contains the css variables as a `js` object, in order to import them directly into your **Tailwind config**.

## How to import your variables into your Tailwind config - Example :

Here is a project architecture example :

```bash
# Project architecture example

app
├── styles
│   └── designsystem # Output folder of the exporter
│       ├── colors.css
│       ├── # Other
│       ├── # css
│       ├── # files...
│       └── tailwind-variables.js
└── tailwind.config.js
```

The idea is to import `tailwind-variables.js` in `tailwind.config.js`

```css
/* File: styles/designsystem/colors.css */
/* This file is automatically generated by the tailwind exporter */

:root {  
    --color-primary-dark2: #1c7a44;
    --color-primary-dark1: #25a35a;
    --color-primary-main: #2ecc71;
    --color-primary-light1: #6ddb9c;
    --color-primary-light2: #abebc6;
    --color-primary-light3: #d5f5e3;
    --color-primary-border: #29b866;
    --color-secondary-dark2: #0e4290;
    --color-secondary-dark1: #1358c0;
    --color-secondary-main: #186ef0;
    --color-secondary-light1: #5d9af5;
    --color-secondary-light2: #a3c5f9;
    --color-secondary-light3: #d1e2fc;
    --color-secondary-border: #1663d8;
}
```

```js
// styles/designsystem/tailwind-variables.js
// This file is automatically generated by the tailwind exporter

module.exports = {
    'colors': {
        'primary': {
            'dark2': 'var(--color-primary-dark2)', 
            'dark1': 'var(--color-primary-dark1)', 
            'DEFAULT': 'var(--color-primary-main)', 
            'light1': 'var(--color-primary-light1)', 
            'light2': 'var(--color-primary-light2)', 
            'light3': 'var(--color-primary-light3)', 
            'border': 'var(--color-primary-border)', 
        },
        'secondary': {
            'border': 'var(--color-secondary-border)', 
            'dark2': 'var(--color-secondary-dark2)', 
            'dark1': 'var(--color-secondary-dark1)', 
            'DEFAULT': 'var(--color-secondary-main)', 
            'light1': 'var(--color-secondary-light1)', 
            'light2': 'var(--color-secondary-light2)', 
            'light3': 'var(--color-secondary-light3)', 
        },
    }
}
```

```js
// tailwind.config.js

const designSystemVariables = require('./styles/designsystem/tailwind-variables'); // Add this line

module.exports = {
    purge: [],
    darkMode: false,
    theme: {
        extend: designSystemVariables, // Add this line
    },
    variants: {
        extend: {},
    },
    plugins: [],
}
```

That's it ! You can now use the **Tailwind variables** in your templates :

```html
<section class="container mx-auto mt-24">

    <h1 class="text-2xl text-primary">Supernova x Tailwind exporter x Tailwind</h1>
    <p class="text-secondary mt-2">Importing your design system</p>
    <ul class="flex mt-2 text-white">
        <li class="p-2 mr-3 rounded bg-primary-dark2">Dark 2</li>
        <li class="p-2 mr-3 rounded bg-primary-dark1">Dark 1</li>
        <li class="p-2 mr-3 rounded bg-primary">Main</li>
        <li class="p-2 mr-3 rounded bg-primary-light1">Light 1</li>
        <li class="p-2 mr-3 rounded bg-primary-light2">Light 2</li>
        <li class="p-2 mr-3 rounded bg-primary-light3">Light 3</li>
    </ul>

</section>
```

Tokens supported for tailwind exporter :

- [x] Color definitions
- [ ] Text Styles
- [ ] Gradients
- [ ] Shadows
- [ ] Borders
- [ ] Radii
- [ ] Measures

---

The CSS allows you to **produce a CSS definitions** in such a way that it can be immediately used in your production codebase to style all your visual elements. Specifically, this exporter is capable of exporting the previews of:

- [x] Color definitions
- [x] Text Styles
- [x] Gradients
- [x] Shadows
- [x] Borders
- [x] Radii
- [x] Measures

You can generate all production ready-code either manually using Supernova's [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SupernovaIO.pulsar-vsc-extension), or automate your code delivery pipeline using Supernova [Design Continuous Delivery](https://supernova.io/automated-code-delivery).


## Example Usage

Once you have run the exporter against your design system, you can start using the code in your codebase right away. To use the output of the exporter, simply add the stylesheets to your html page, like this:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Style import test</title>
  <style>
    @import ".build/index.css";
  </style>
 </head>
</html>
```

Because tokens are defined as css variables, you can use them as such, anywhere you need that value (even in order definitions):

```
<p style="color: var(--colorContrast)">...</p>
```

## Installing
